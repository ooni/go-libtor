# go-libtor - Self-contained Tor from Go

[![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/berty.tech/go-libtor)](https://pkg.go.dev/berty.tech/go-libtor)[![Update Libs](https://github.com/berty/go-libtor/workflows/Update%20Libs/badge.svg)](https://github.com/berty/go-libtor/actions?query=workflow%3AUpdate+Libs)

The `go-libtor` project is a self-contained, fully statically linked Tor library for Go. It consists of an elaborate suite of Go/CGO wrappers around the original C/C++ Tor library and its dependencies ([zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib), [libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent) and [openssl](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)).

The library is currently supported on:

 - Linux `amd64`, `x86`, `arm64` and `arm`; both with `libc` and `musl` (`musl` need to checked again in the CI).
 - Android `amd64`, `x86`, `arm64` and `arm`; specifically via `gomobile` (need to be checked again in the CI).
 - Darwin (Macos and iOS) `amd64` and `arm64`.

## Installation (Go modules)

This library is compatible with Go modules. All you need is to import `berty.tech/go-libtor` and wait out the build. We suggest running `go build -v -x` the first time after adding the `go-libtor` dependency to avoid frustration, otherwise Go will build the 1000+ C files without any progress report.

## Installation (GOPATH)

The goal of this library is to be a self-contained Tor package for Go. As such, it plays nice with the usual `go get` workflow. That said, building Tor and all its dependencies locally can take quite a while, so it's recommended to run `go get` in verbose mode.

```
$ go get -u -v -x github.com/ooni/go-libtor
```

You'll also need the [`bine`](https://github.com/cretz/bine) bindings to interface with the library:

```
go get -u github.com/cretz/bine/tor
```

However to ensure a build consistency across all users of your project we recommend using **go mod**.

## Usage

The `go-libtor` project does not contain a full Go API to interface Tor with, rather only the smallest building block to start up an embedded instance. The reason is because there is already a solid Go project out there ([github.com/cretz/bine](https://github.com/cretz/bine)) which focuses on interfacing.

Using both projects in combination however is straightforward:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/cretz/bine/tor"
	"github.com/ooni/go-libtor"
)

func main() {
	// Start tor with some defaults + elevated verbosity
	fmt.Println("Starting and registering onion service, please wait a bit...")
	t, err := tor.Start(nil, &tor.StartConf{ProcessCreator: libtor.Creator, DebugWriter: os.Stderr})
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Failed to start tor: %v", err)
	}
	defer t.Close()

	// Wait at most a few minutes to publish the service
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Minute)
	defer cancel()

	// Create an onion service to listen on any port but show as 80
	onion, err := t.Listen(ctx, &tor.ListenConf{RemotePorts: []int{80}})
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Failed to create onion service: %v", err)
	}
	defer onion.Close()

	fmt.Printf("Please open a Tor capable browser and navigate to http://%v.onion\n", onion.ID)

	// Run a Hello-World HTTP service until terminated
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Tor!")
	})
	http.Serve(onion, nil)
}
```

The above code will:

 * Start up a new Tor process from within your statically linked binary
 * Register a new anonymous onion TCP endpoint for remote clients
 * Start an HTTP server using the Tor network as its transport layer

```
$ go run main.go

Starting and registering onion service, please wait a bit...
[...]
Enabling network before waiting for publication
[...]
Waiting for publication
[...]
Please open a Tor capable browser and navigate to http://s7t3iy76h54cjacg.onion
```

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berty/go-libtor/master/demo.png)

Well, that was easy. With a few lines of Go code we've created a hidden TCP service inside the Tor network. The browser used to test the server with above was [Brave](https://brave.com/), which among others has built in experimental support for Tor.

## Mobile devices

The advantage of `go-libtor` starts to show when building to more exotic platforms, since it's composed of simple CGO Go files. As it doesn't require custom build steps or tooling, it plays nice with the Go ecosystem, `gomobile` included:

Let's see how much effort would it be to deploy onto Android:

```go
package demo

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/cretz/bine/tor"
	"github.com/ooni/go-libtor"
)

// Run starts up an embedded Tor process, starts a hidden onion service on a new
// goroutine and returns the onion address. We're cheating here and not caring
// about actually cleaning up after ourselves.
func Run(datadir string) string {
	// Start tor with some defaults + elevated verbosity
	fmt.Println("Starting and registering onion service, please wait a bit...")
	t, err := tor.Start(nil, &tor.StartConf{ProcessCreator: libtor.Creator, DebugWriter: os.Stderr, DataDir: datadir})
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Failed to start tor: %v", err)
	}
	// Wait at most a few minutes to publish the service
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 3*time.Minute)
	defer cancel()

	// Create an onion service to listen on any port but show as 80
	onion, err := t.Listen(ctx, &tor.ListenConf{RemotePorts: []int{80}})
	if err != nil {
		log.Panicf("Failed to create onion service: %v", err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("Please open a Tor capable browser and navigate to http://%v.onion\n", onion.ID)

	// Run a Hello-World HTTP service until terminated
	http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Tor! This is Android!!!")
	})
	go http.Serve(onion, nil)

	return fmt.Sprintf("http://%v.onion", onion.ID)
}
```

The above code does approximately the same thing as the one before, just in its own package with a trivial API since we want to make an Android archive, not an entire `.apk`. We can invoke `gomobile` to bind it:

```
$ gomobile bind -v -x .
[...many logs, much wow...]
$ ls -al demo*
-rw-r--r-- 1 karalabe 38976071 Jul 19 18:46 demo.aar
-rw-r--r-- 1 karalabe     6162 Jul 19 18:46 demo-sources.jar
$ unzip -l demo.aar
Archive:  demo.aar

```

Explaining how to load an `.aar` into an Android project is beyond the scope of this article, but you can load the archive with Android Studio as a module and edit your Gradle build config to add it as a dependency. An overly crude app would just start the server and drop the onion URL into an Android label:

![Android](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ooni/go-libtor/master/demo.jpg)

That's actually it! We've managed to get a Tor hidden service running from an Android phone and access it from another device through the Tor network, all through 40 lines of Go- and 3 lines of Java code.

## Updating libraries

To perform a manual update of the libraries, you should run from the root of
the repo the following (this assumes you are on macOS system):
```
go run build/wrap.go --nobuild --update
./build/local-linux-build.sh
```

If something breaks or doesn't work as expected, you might have to update the
configuration headers for the library you are building.
These are found inside of:
* `tor_config/orconfig.*.h`
* `openssl_config/buildinf.*.h`
* `libevent_config/event2/event-config.*.h`

To aid the process of re-generating these headers, you can use the
[cross-build-tor repo](https://github.com/ooni/cross-build-tor).
